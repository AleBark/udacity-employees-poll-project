# Employee Polls project

To run the project without major problems, it's recommended to use the following versions on Node and Npm:

```Node version: v18.12.1```
```Npm version: 8.19.2```

Node and Npm versions can be easily managed through [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

After that, it should be simple as: running ```npm install``` && ```npm start```. 
To run the application tests, use ```npm start test``` command
